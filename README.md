# freetours
A solution for a Free Tours platform.

The project was built with the aim of enabling a simple tourist/guide match in some specific tour schedules. In that sense, we built a **Spring Backend** which represents the API, being the proocessing element of the system. We also built a **Vue Frontend** which represents the software which the client interacts. In order for the system to work, we provided some docker **Deployment** solutions, and in the end we tested the system with some load.

This project was carried out for 2 different disciplines (Application Architectures and Interactive Systems), in the second semester of the fourth year of informatics engineering course at University of Minho. [2019-2020]
